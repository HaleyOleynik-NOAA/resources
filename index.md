[The NOAA Fisheries Integrated Toolbox](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/) inlcudes scientific tools and software applications developed with contributions from scientists and programmers at NOAA and at external organizations. Tools from individual groups are found under the  four organizations, with a fifth group that includes general tools that may be used across disciplines or for general analyis.

<ul class ="tools_list">
    <li style="background:rgba(10,69,149,0.4);" >Fish and Fisheries</li>
    <li style="background:rgba(10,69,149,.55);" >Protected Species</li>
    <li style="background:rgba(10,69,149,.7);" >Human Dimensions</li>
    <li style="background:rgba(10,69,149,.85);" >Ecosystems</li>
  <li style="background:#0a4595;" >General Modeling Tools</li>
</ul>

This Resources page provides resources associated with each 'drawer' of the toolbox for users, as well as resources for developers of tools. To contribute to the toolbox see [Contributing](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/resources/onboarding/contributing/) and to include a tool in the toolbox see [Onboarding Procedures](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/resources/onboarding/overview/).
