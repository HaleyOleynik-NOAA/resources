Eli Holmes from the Northwest Center hosted an 8-part [Practical R Workflow workshop](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2021/) series. The series focused on tools and practices for NMFS scientists to help you be faster, more efficient, and organized in your coding and merging reports with code.

## Topics covered

| Topic | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Introduction to workflow using RStudio and Git/GitHub](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2021/week1.html)  | The session video will be posted June 2nd but the link has my lectures notes and short videos of the skills. | 
| [More Git/Github](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2021/week2.html)  | The 3 key Git skills. These 3 basic skills are all you need for 95% of your work with Git repositories. |
| [Key Git/GitHub skills](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2021/week3.html)  | We’ll learn how to use issues and releases on GitHub to be more efficient either working alone or in a team. I’ll show you how I use organizations to organize my repositories and some of the nice ‘landing page’ features of GitHub. For those curious about GitHub Actions, I give you a short demo on that too. | 
| [Rmarkdown for reports](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2021/week4.html)  | Let’s make a report that updates when our data change and post that to GitHub. |
| [Making plots with ggplot2](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2021/week5.html)  | Learning ggplot2 will make it much easier to make plots from the big and complex datasets that you deal with on a daily basis. |
| [Intro to R packages](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2021/week6.html)  | How to build an R package in RStudio. In the second half of the lecture, I will show you how to make an R data package and what that can do to allow data documentation, data revision tracking, data versioning and data sharing. |
| [Roxygen2 and pkgdown](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2021/week7.html)  | Even if you don’t do the coding on your team, you should be aware of how documentation works so you can contribute and the tools for automating tasks like a project website so your team doesn’t fall into inefficient workflows. |
| [Advanced Topics for Developers](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2021/week8.html)  | How to set up a NAMESPACE, passing `R CMD check`, debugging tools, coding GitHub Actions workflows, C++ code in your package. I am going to pass on tips to help you understand how these things work so you don’t waste hours figuring it out or fall back on hacky solutions. |
